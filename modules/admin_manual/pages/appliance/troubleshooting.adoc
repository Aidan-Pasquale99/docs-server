= Troubleshooting

If you have encountered an issue, here is what customer support needs in order to provide a rapid resolution to your issue:

. The applianceâ€™s log file located (`/var/lib/univention-appcenter/apps/owncloud/data/files/owncloud.log`)
. A config report. 
. The status of your docker containers.
. The status of your appliance.
. Docker log files.

Here is how to retrieve all of the information above:

[source,console]
----
# Generate a config report. 
# Log in to the container with: univention-app shell owncloud
occ configreport:generate > config_report.json

# Obtain the status of your docker containers 
docker ps > docker.txt 

# Obtain the status of your appliance 
univention-app info > univention.txt

# Obtain the Docker log files 
docker logs <containerID or container name> 
----

IMPORTANT: Restore a snapshot to get your appliance to a functional state again.
