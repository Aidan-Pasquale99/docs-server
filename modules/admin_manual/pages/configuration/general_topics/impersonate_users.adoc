= Impersonating Users

:page-aliases: issues/impersonate_users.adoc

:description: To help users debug an issue or to get a better understanding of what they see when they use their ownCloud account, you can impersonate their ownCloud user.

== Introduction

{description} The ability to do so is a feature delivered via an ownCloud app called {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/impersonate[Impersonate].

== Limitations

* This functionality is available to administrators only.
* Impersonating is not possible when using Shibboleth or OpenID.

== Impersonating a User

When installed, you can then impersonate users; in effect, you will be logged in as a specific user. To do so, go to the Users list, where you will now see a new column available called btn:Impersonate[], as in the screenshot below.

Click the gray head icon next to the user that you want to impersonate. Doing so will log you in as that user, temporarily pausing your current session. You will see a notification at the top of the page that confirms you're now logged in as (or impersonating) that user.

Anything that you see until you log out will be what that user would see.

== Ending an Impersonation

When you're ready to stop impersonating the user, log out and you will return to your normal user session.

== Define Who is Granted to Impersonate

As a security measure, the application lets ownCloud administrators restrict the ability to impersonate users to:

- ownCloud administrators only.
- All group administrators.
- Administrators for specific groups.

NOTE: By default, when the Impersonate app is installed and no further configuration is taken, only the ownCloud administrator will be allowed to impersonate users.

To configure impersonation, go to the administrator settings panel, which you can find under menu:User Name[Settings > Admin > User Authentication], at section titled: btn:[Impersonate Settings].

* Use the following to allow impersonation for ownCloud admins only:

* If you want to allow all group admins to impersonate users within groups which they administer:

* If you want to limit impersonation to admins of specific groups, first click btn:[Allow group admins of specific groups...]. With the option checked, click into the textbox underneath it. You will see a list of all groups on your ownCloud installation, which will change, based on what you type in the textbox to search for specific groups. Choose one or more groups from the list, and they will be added to the textbox, restricting this functionality to admins of those groups only.
