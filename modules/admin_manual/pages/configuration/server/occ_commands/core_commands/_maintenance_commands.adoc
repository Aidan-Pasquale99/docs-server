== Update the Systems Data-Fingerprint

When a backup has been restored, the ETag information, which is necessary when accessing ownCloud with clients, has been changed. Run the following command to tell desktop and mobile clients that a server backup has been restored.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:data-fingerprint
----

This command changes the ETag for all files in the communication with sync clients, informing them that one or more files were modified. After the command completes, users will be prompted to resolve any conflicts between newer and older file versions.

== Install ownCloud

NOTE: This command is only available if the following key in your `config.php` is not present or set to `false`. This is the case when the installation has not been made or not finalized. This key automatically turns to `true` after a successful installation. This results in the command no longer being available.

[source,php]
----
'installed' => false,
