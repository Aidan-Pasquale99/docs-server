== Introduction

After installing ownCloud, you may provide added functionality by installing applications.

== Installing and Managing Apps

=== Managing Apps

Some apps are installed and enabled during ownCloud installation. 
Other apps can be installed and enabled later on. 
To see the status of your installation's applications, go to your Apps page, via menu:Settings[Admin > Settings].

There, you will see which apps are currently: _enabled_, _not enabled_, and _recommended_. 
You'll also see additional filters, such as _Multimedia_, _Productivity_, and _Tool_ for finding more apps quickly.

[NOTE]
====
*Supported Enterprise Apps*
See xref:installation/apps_supported.adoc[supported apps] for a list of supported Enterprise edition apps.

On the Apps page (menu:Settings[Admin > Apps]), you can enable or disable applications. 
Some apps have configurable options on the Apps page, such as *Enable only for specific groups*. 
However, this is the exception.
Apps are mainly configured from your ownCloud Personal or Admin settings page, or in `config.php`.

=== Installing Apps Via the ownCloud Marketplace

To add an app, use the Market app, which is accessible from the top-level navigation bar on the left-hand side of the page. 
Once in the Market, click an app's name to view more details about it.
Once you have done this, you can install it by clicking btn:[Install]. 
Doing this, downloads it from the ownCloud Marketplace, installs and enables it.

Sometimes the installation of a third-party app fails silently, possibly because `appcodechecker' => true,` is enabled in `config.php`. 
When `appcodechecker` is enabled, it checks if third-party apps are using the private API, rather than the public API. 
If they are, they are not installed.

NOTE: If you would like to create or add (your own) ownCloud app, please refer to the xref:developer_manual:app/introduction.adoc[developer manual].

To install an app manually instead of by using {marketplace-url}[the ownCloud Marketplace], copy the app either into ownCloud’s default app folder (`</path/to/owncloud>/apps`) or xref:using-custom-app-directories[a custom app folder].

Be aware that the name of the app and its folder name *must be identical*! 
You can find these details in the application's metadata file, located in `<app directory>/appinfo/info.xml`.

Using the example below, both the app's name and directory name would be `yourappname`.

=== Installing Apps Manually

In addition to the using the ownCloud Marketplace, apps can be installed manually.
To do so, place the app in one of your ownCloud’s app directories, ideally a custom app directory and then follow the instructions below:

. Run `composer install` inside the app’s directory.
. Enable the app via either:
** Navigating to menu:Settings[Admin > Apps] and clicking btn:[Enable]; or 
** Using xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#app-command[the occ app command].

== Using Custom App Directories

There are several reasons for using custom app directories instead of ownCloud's default. 
These are:

. It separates ownCloud's core apps from user or admin downloaded apps. 
Doing so distinguishes which apps are core and which aren't, simplifying upgrades.
. It eases manual upgrades. 
Having non-core apps in a directory separate to the core app directory makes them simpler to manage.
. ownCloud may gain new core apps in newer versions. 
Doing so orphans deprecated apps, but doesn't remove them.

If you want to store apps in a custom directory, instead of ownCloud's default (`/app`), you need to modify the `apps_paths` element in `config/config.php`. 
There, you need to add a new associative array that contains three elements. 
These are:

`path`:: The absolute file system path to the custom app folder.
`url`:: The request path to that folder relative to the ownCloud webroot, prefixed with `/`.
`writable`:: Whether users can install apps in that folder. 

After adding the configuration, ownCloud only installs apps in directories where `writable` is set to `true`.
The configuration example below shows how to add a second directory, called `apps-external`.

After you add a new directory configuration, you can then move apps from the original app directory to the new one. 
To do so, follow these steps:

. xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[Enable maintenance mode].
. xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[Disable the apps] that you want to move.
. Create a new apps directory and assign it the same user and group, and ownership permissions as the core apps directory.
. Move the apps from the old apps directory to the new apps directory.
. Add a new app directory in `config/config.php`.
. If you’re using a cache, such as xref:configuration/server/caching_configuration.adoc#clearing-the-redis-cache[Redis] or xref:configuration/server/caching_configuration.adoc#clearing-the-memcached-cache[Memcached], ensure that you clear the cache.

. xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[Disable maintenance mode].
